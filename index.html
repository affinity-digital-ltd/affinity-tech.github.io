  <h1><a href="https://forestsangha.org">Forest Sangha</a></h1>
  <p><b>The Thai Forest tradition is one branch of the Theravada Buddhist tradition. Theravada Buddhism, also known as the Southern School of Buddhism, is present throughout Thailand, Burma, and Sri Lanka. The Theravada tradition is grounded in the discourses recorded in the Pali Canon, the oldest Buddhist scriptures. Theravada literally means the Way of the Elders, and is named so because of its strict adherence to the original teachings and rules of monastic discipline expounded by the Buddha.</b></p>
  <p>It has been our great pleasure to develop this site in conjuction with the monastic community.</p>
  <p>This reimagination of their previous site has allowed them to manage the website without the need for a web master and has vastly reduced the barrier to technology.</p>

  <p><b>Aruna Ratanagiri: Harnham Buddhist Monastery is a Theravada Buddhist community on the border of England and Scotland. The abbot, Ajahn Munindo, was ordained by the late Venerable Ajahn Chah of Wat Nong Pah Pong in North East Thailand in 1975. The community comprises of a monastic residence for about nine Sangha members and an adjacent lay retreat facility known as Kusala House.</b></p>
  <p>Giving back to the community is at the heart of what we believe in. The website we have developed and donated to Harnham has resulted in a reduction of time and costs in administration. Resources which can now be spent on other areas of the monastery.</p><p>We have thoroughly enjoyed developing this site and will continue to do so for years to come.</p>

A secular organisation that is open to everybody, it is wholly run by volunteers for volunteers and as such has no overheads of any description. Their objective is to organise or source a variety of projects, with the aim of bringing together two specific groups of people; namely those with a desire to serve and those that are in need.</b></p>
  <p>We are very proud to be given the opportunity to redesign and develop a new platform for the charity to update the community on their latest projects.  Not only have we provided them with a more user friendly experience, supplied tools to control their content easily but also saved the charity money in annual hosting fees.  Most importantly, we are very honered to be able to donate our services to such a good cause.</p>

  <h1><a href="http://www.dskri.be">d'Skribe</a></h1>
  <p><b>What once began as an in-house app to help us create eBooks, has now become
    a public facing tool in order for us to give back to the community what we have
    found to be a great timesaver.  Currently, this is only capable of exporting to .ePub
    format which can be read in apps such as iBooks and .mobi for Kindle devices</b></p>
  <p>Current features include, the ability to reorder sections (i.e. chapters) of the
    book by drag and dropping them, editing and deleting sections and supporting the
    Markdown syntax to write content.  Markdown is a very quick and easy way to style
    and control HTML.  We have just recently introduced the option to export your
    book as a .mobi file which can be used with Amazon's Kindle line of readers.  We also plan to include support for adding front cover images and further control over the style of your content.  There are also plans to include integrated services to help have your book published or even printed.  If you would like to see a certain feature integrated into the site, then we would love to hear from you.  Ideas can be sent to us from our contact page form.</p>

  <p>d'Skribe runs on the following technologies:</p>
