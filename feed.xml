        <title>eBook Generator Now Supports Exporting to Kindle</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Following the release of v1 of the eBook Gem, which has just had a minor revision
 &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krisquigley/ebook_generator&quot;&gt;update to 1.0.3&lt;/a&gt;, we have now
 updated the our &lt;a href=&quot;http://ebook-generator.affinity-tech.com/&quot;&gt;eBook Generator frontend&lt;/a&gt;
  to support this new functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any ideas for us on what features you would like to see, please
leave your opinions in the comments below. We would love to hear them!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Version one of eBook Gem goes live!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We are proud to announce a much needed update to our eBook Gem.  The version number has been
bumped up to 1.0 to signify that the codebase is a lot more mature, and also brings in
incompatibilities over previous versions due to the changes in codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The codebase is now covered by a test suite which should mean that it is stable enough to use
in a production environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amongst the changes, the gem now takes an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ebook Object&lt;/code&gt; rather than an id to generate the file.
It also returns the path of the file generated for your convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;EbookGenerator.generate_ebook(ebook_object)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is now support to generate Kindle .mobi eBooks, but this requires the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211&quot;&gt;Kindlegen&lt;/a&gt; command line tool
to be placed in the Rails app &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/bin&lt;/code&gt; folder first.  To generate a Kindle .mobi file instead of an .ePub
requires the passing of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;kindle&lt;/code&gt; as a second argument:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;EbookGenerator.generate_ebook(ebook_object, 'kindle')&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gem has also been completely reorganised so that it is now a Rails plugin with built in
 generators to generate the Ebook and Section models and relevant migrations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$ rails g ebook_generator&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the models have been redesigned so as not to rely on Postgres or Friendly_id, this
is to give you the freedom to choose your flavour of database and how to generate your own
slugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would love to hear your thoughts on the gem and can even &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krisquigley/ebook_generator&quot;&gt;fork us on github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also be updating our eBook generator frontend to use the new features introduced in this version.
 Expect an update in the following days.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Yellow River Soup Kitchen</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We are very pleased to announce that we are currently developing a new website for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yellowrivercharity.com&quot;&gt;Yellow River Soup Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once completed, the new website will be donated to the charity, potentially saving them money each year.  Money which could be used to further support those in need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yellow River Soup Kitchen is a not for profit NGO, registered in the UK. A secular organisation that is open to everybody, it is wholly run by volunteers for volunteers and as such has no overheads of any description. Their objective is to organise or source a variety of projects, with the aim of bringing together two specific groups of people; namely those with a desire to serve and those that are in need. Hence, providing an opportunity, a vehicle, support and empowerment, to enable volunteers to channel their energies for the benefit of others whilst at the same time achieving personal growth and development. Facilitating the opportunity to cultivate a small change inside, potentially manifesting in a larger change outside.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Over 1000 Downloads</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We have surpassed the 1000 download mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we passed 1000 downloads for our eBook Generator Gem.  It is very promising to see the interest in such a gem, especially in it’s early stage of development.  We have high hopes for this gem and have many &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.affinity-tech.com&quot;&gt;features&lt;/a&gt; planned in the pipe-line.  If you would like to use this gem, fork it, or just provide us with feedback then please see our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krisquigley/ebook_generator&quot;&gt;github page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
