We have surpassed the 1000 download mark.

This week we passed 1000 downloads for our eBook Generator Gem.  It is very promising to see the interest in such a gem, especially in it's early stage of development.  We have high hopes for this gem and have many [features](http://www.affinity-tech.com) planned in the pipe-line.  If you would like to use this gem, fork it, or just provide us with feedback then please see our [github page](https://github.com/krisquigley/ebook_generator).
