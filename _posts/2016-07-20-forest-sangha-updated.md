Today we are announcing a very important update for the [Forest Sangha](https://forestsangha.org) website.

Users are now able to order, free of charge, a selection of publications provided by the forest sangha group of monasteries.

We will be reimplementing the original functionaliy of ordering books and audio discs at a later date.

For more information see our [projects page](http://www.affinity-tech.com).
