We have just redesigned our site.  Although we are still putting the finishing touches in place, we hope you like what we have done so far.

If you have any comments that you would like to make about the design (all praise and criticism welcome) then please do so in the comments below, which brings me on to my next point.

As you can see below we have now implemented comments using the [disqus] platform, a very easy and simple implementation indeed.  Last but not least, we have also just upgraded the site to [Jekyll] 2.0.0 which introduces some nice additions such as support for SASS and TurboLinks.
