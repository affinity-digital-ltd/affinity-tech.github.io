We have recently updated the design of our site to fully support mobile and tablet
 devices.

This means that your surfing experience will be much more enjoyable when you are on
 the move!  If you spot any problems with the new design, then please be sure to
  [let us know](http://www.affinity-tech.com/index.html#contact).

On another note, we are currently in the beginnings of a new community project.  
We cannot disclose too much at this time, however, we hope to give you some sneak
 previews of the design further down the line.  If you are a charity owner in the need
  of our free services or would like a reasonably priced website for your business,
   then drop us an email to [info@affinity-tech.com](mailto:info@affinity-tech.com).
