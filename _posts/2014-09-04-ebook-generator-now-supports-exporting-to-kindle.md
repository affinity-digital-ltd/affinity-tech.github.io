Following the release of v1 of the eBook Gem, which has just had a minor revision
 [update to 1.0.3](https://github.com/krisquigley/ebook_generator), we have now
 updated the our [eBook Generator frontend](http://ebook-generator.affinity-tech.com/)
  to support this new functionality.

If you have any ideas for us on what features you would like to see, please
leave your opinions in the comments below. We would love to hear them!
